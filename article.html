        <h1>Leading Causes of Death in the United States</h1>
        <p>While I was focusing on the leading causes of death in several states and cities, I noticed the similarity of the top two causes across the country. Read my article, Heart disease and cancer are steadily the two leading causes of death in the United States, and learn more about this accumulation of data.</p>

         <p>Heart disease and cancer are steadily the two leading causes of death in the United States.<p>



 <p>The highest mortality rates are linked to heart disease as the first cause and cancer (malignant neoplasms) as the second cause. According to the, “10 Leading Causes of Death, New York City, 2017-2019, Highlighting Injury Annual Average Count” report from NYC Open Data, there was a total of 17,865 recorded deaths from heart disease,14,749 of which were 65 years of age or older. From the same report, there was a total of 12,927 deaths from malignant neoplasms, 9,000 of which were of 65 years or older.<p> 

  <p>There are similarities between Syracuse, New York, and New York, New York. The leading causes of death in Syracuse, New York are first heart disease and then cancer, according to the  “City of Syracuse Health Equity Report” from the New York State Department of Health. With the number one cause being heart disease, there were 186.9 deaths per 100,000 cases and 200.9 per 100,000 cases of malignant neoplasms, according to “Leading causes of death for City of Syracuse, Onondaga County, and New York State, 2011-2013” found in the “City of Syracuse Health Equity Report”.<p>

<p>This similarity continues as heart disease is the number one cause of death and cancer (malignant neoplasms) is the second leading cause of death in this city according to the “City of Buffalo Health Equity Report”. The “Leading causes of death for City of Buffalo, Erie County and New York State, 2011-2013” shows that there are 214.2 deaths per 100,000 cases for heart disease and 204.8 deaths per 100,000 cases for cancer (malignant neoplasms).<p>

<p>Data found in three separate cities in New York has led to continued research about the leading causes of death in other states within the country. These similarities have found that every state within the country shares the top two leading causes of death due to the troubles that each state faces.<p>

<p>The causes of heart disease and cancer vary in different groups by education, geography, income levels, race, ethnicity, and age. Modifiable risks are also to be taken into accounts, such as smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and family history. All of these can be managed by taking care of one's body and watching one's own blood pressure and cholesterol, properly treating diabetes, as well as eating a well-balanced diet, according to Associate Professor of Anesthesiology, Joseph Caiati.<p>

<p>“You’ll find that some of these states in the center of the country…obesity is just common and socially acceptable, just like how smoking is socially acceptable and so for that reason you’re going to see the rates of these diseases to be different than others without higher rates of these factors,” says Caiati.<p>

<p>The big factor that contributes to heart disease and cancer is smoking.<p> 

<p>“These days, smoking tends to follow education and income, and it's mostly lesser educated people and people in the lower-income brackets that tend to smoke, and so that also goes along with geographic risk factors, income inequality, etc” he said.<p>

<p>Levels of education, income, and lifestyle choices vary depending on the certain state. Associate Professor Caiati says,  “I think the problem with healthcare in the United States is that we are so focused on trying to fix things once these disease processes have happened and we spend so little money, effort,  time, and energy on making people educated to make good lifestyle choices”.<p>

<p>Obesity is a risk factor for certain types of cancer, not just heart disease, and paying attention to the body mass index of different states helps clarify why heart disease and cancer cause the most deaths. BMI is derived by the mass and height of a person and not simply their weight. A person's BMI is a good indicator of their health as it is specific to surface skin and height, along with their weight. Unsteady BMI can tie people to ovarian cancer as well as cancer in other parts of the body, according to Associate Professor Joseph Caiati.<p>

<p>Lung and colon cancer are the two most common types of cancer and if risk factors such as smoking, alcohol abuse, and obesity are not monitored properly, they can lead to such cancers.<p>

<p>The overall problem in the United States that is continuously keeping heart disease and cancer mortality rates at a high is the lifestyle choices of Americans, not solely the state they live in.<p> 

<p>“It's not whether people live in New York or Missouri, the point is that people need to keep their BMI below 25 and avoid smoking, excessive drinking, etc” says Caiati.<p>
